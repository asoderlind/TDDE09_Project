## Abstract:

In this project we extended the baseline, which included an arc-standard parser with a static oracle,
with an arc-hybrid parser and a dynamic oracle. The dynamic oracle may only be used with the arc-hybrid parser,
however, since it requires a parsing system that is arc-decomposable. According to the litterature, the arc-hybrid
parser with a static oracle should perform equally well as the arc-standard. It was also found that the dynamic oracle
should perform better than the static oracle, both using arc-hybrid parsing.[^1] 
To improve the dynamic oracle further we choose to implement exploration parametres for the dynamic oracle according to "A Dynamic Oracle for Arc-Eager Dependency Parsin" 
by Goldberg & Nivre. Our result indicates... [^2]

## Data:

We used batch_size = 15 with k = 2 and p = 0.9 as our exploration parametres for the dynamic oracle.
The result shows the avarage values over 5 different seeds. The seeds used were 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and 
the same seed were both used for random.seed(SEED) and torch.manual_seed(SEED) for reproducibility.
