## Abstract:

In this project we extended the baseline, which included an arc-standard parser with a static oracle,
with an arc-hybrid parser and a dynamic oracle. The dynamic oracle may only be used with the arc-hybrid parser,
however, since it requires a parsing system that is arc-decomposable. According to the litterature, the arc-hybrid
parser with a static oracle should perform equally well as the arc-standard. It was also found that the dynamic oracle
should perform better than the static oracle, both using arc-hybrid parsing. We then ran these on treebanks for English, 
Japanese and Swedish, and our showed improvements of the unlabelled attatchment score in (both dynamic oracles and) arc-hybrid 
parser, with specific scores shown in the tables below.

## Data:

We set the seed `torch.manual_seed(12345)` for reproducibiilty.

### English treebank:

| Parsing system | Oracle  | Tagging Accuracy | Unlabelled attachment score |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| arc-standard   | static  | (Golden tags)    | 0.7419                      |
| arc-standard   | static  | 0.8846           | 0.6945                      |
| arc-hybrid     | static  | (Golden tags)    | 0.7535                      |
| arc-hybrid     | static  | 0.8846           | 0.7032                      |
| arc-hybrid     | dynamic | (Golden tags)    | 0.7301                      |
| arc-hybrid     | dynamic | 0.8846           | 0.6815                      |

| arc-hybrid     | static  | 0.9511           | 0.8538                      |
| arc-hybrid     | dynamic | (Golden tags)    | 0.7797                      |
| arc-hybrid     | dynamic | 0.9511           | 0.7672                      |

### Swedish treebank:

| Parsing system | Oracle  | Tagging Accuracy | Unlabelled attachment score |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| arc-standard   | static  | (Golden tags)    | 0.7145                      |
| arc-standard   | static  | 0.9035           | 0.6436                      |
| arc-hybrid     | static  | (Golden tags)    | 0.6774                      |
| arc-hybrid     | static  | 0.9035           | 0.6179                      |
| arc-hybrid     | dynamic | (Golden tags)    | 0.6883                      |
| arc-hybrid     | dynamic | 0.9035           | 0.6179                      |

## Structure

`baseline.py` - the main entrypoint

`parsing.py` - includes the parsing classes and `get_uas` evaluation function

`tagging.py` - includes the tagging classes and `accuracy` evaluation function

`models.py` - includes the base network `FixedWindowModel` that is trained

`utils.py` - includes any constants and helper functions such as `make_vocabs`

`treebank.py` - includes the `Treebank` class

## Usage

### Running on all treebanks

```shell
python3 baseline.py
```

### Running on specific treebank

```shell
python3 baseline.py {treebank}
```

### Currently the avaiable treebanks are
